		<h1>Project Brief</h1>
		<p><i>"We are in the midst of the largest public health crisis in recent history. The rapid nature of the spread of this pandemic has led to unprecedented timelines for development of virus testing, product development, medical and pharmacological responses, and architectural REACTIONs. In this studio we will focus on creation of a three-fold Response Experience for Active Contagion Tracking-Innovation-Organization Nexus that caters to needs of virus testing, contact tracing, and staff spaces. Your design should provide means for each of these necessities as well as afford opportunities for dissemination of information, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for personnel, and hygienic solutions in an innovative and organized fashion. Your design solution should be able to be packed up and shipped via tractor trailer to various sites as the virus spikes shifts location, a resurgence occurs, or the nature of the virus and relative societal needs adapt to virus prevention through medical means such as vaccines or other treatments. Your response should be adaptive, flexible, and mobile. This nexus serves both local and visiting professional staff."</i></p>
